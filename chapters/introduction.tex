There are many parser generators that have a similar approach, but different goals. One major example is ANTLR, which generates a parser for a given grammar. The generated parsers are mainly used for further use in a compiler. This usecase differs from the usecase of refactoring, as the compiler does not need whitespaces, comments or preprocessor statements in most cases. In the use case of refactoring, we need to preserve all of these tokens to reconstruct the source code as accurately as possible. We do not want to loose all comments due to a refactoring beeing made. Also, this thesis provides a tool which provides an API specifically aimed to refactor source code.
