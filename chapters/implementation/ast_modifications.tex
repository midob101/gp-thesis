\subsection{AST Modifications}

The \verb|AbstractSyntaxTreeNode| class contains several methods for making changes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb|replace|  Replaces this node with one node or a list of other nodes.
\item \verb|replaceChild|  Replaces a node in its children with one node or a list of other nodes.
\item \verb|remove| Removes this node and its subtree.
\item \verb|removeChild| Removes a child.
\item \verb|addChild| Adds a child to the end of the child list.
\item \verb|addChildBefore| Adds a child before another node.
\item \verb|addChildAfter| Adds a child after another node.
\item \verb|deepClone| Clones this node and all its children, returning a node that is the same as the current one, but without a parent reference.
\end{enumerate}

Each \verb|AbstractSyntaxTreeNode| references its corresponding parent node. 
To maintain integrity, you can only add nodes that have no parent node, and only replace nodes with a parent reference. 
To add a node to several other nodes, you can clone the node to be added.
