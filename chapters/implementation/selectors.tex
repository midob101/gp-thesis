\subsection{Selectors}

A \verb|Selector| is a class instance that should test whether a given tree node matches the rules defined by the \verb|Selector|. 
The \verb|Selectors| can be divided into three different categories.

The first category are logical \verb|Selectors|. They should represent logical operations. 
There are two \verb|Selectors| defined by default, \verb|AndSelector| and \verb|OrSelector|. 
Each takes a list of other selectors. The \verb|AndSelector| will only match tree nodes that match all passed \verb|Selectors|. 
The \verb|OrSelector| will match all tree nodes where at least one of the passed \verb|Selectors| matches the node.


The second category are data \verb|Selectors|. 
These selectors search for nodes based on the data they contain. 
They can match the name of a production, the alias of a production, the name of a lexer definition, and the value of a lexer token. 
The implemented selectors are \verb|AliasSelector|,\verb|ProductionSelector|,\verb|TokenSelector|,\verb|TokenValueSelector|. 
All of these take a string as a parameter and check the corresponding notes for that string.


The last category are structural \verb|Selectors|. 
These selectors search for nodes that have specific nodes in their children or parents.

The following example of an AST is intended to illustrate the purpose of this category.

To search for all \verb|METHOD_CALL| nodes, that call translate on a translator object, these types of selectors will be used.

An example selector for this would be

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption=Selector example]
new AndSelector(
	new ProductionSelector("METHOD_CALL"),
	new HasImmediateChildSelector(
		new AndSelector(
			new ProductionSelector("CALLED_ON"),
			new HasImmediateChildSelector(
				new TokenValueSelector("translator")
			)
		)
	),
	new HasImmediateChildSelector(
		new AndSelector(
			new ProductionSelector("METHOD_NAME"),
			new HasImmediateChildSelector(
				new TokenValueSelector("translate")
			)
		)
	)
)
\end{lstlisting}

By calling the \verb|query| method on the root node of the AST, all the \verb|METHOD_CALL| nodes in the AST that match those conditions will be returned.
