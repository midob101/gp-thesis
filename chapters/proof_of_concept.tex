\section{Use cases}

This chapter contains some refactorings that have been implemented on MiniJava and some refactoring examples are shown, 
which have not been implemented due to the limited grammar of MiniJava.

The implementation of the examples can be found here \cite{gp-modifiable-ast-examples}.
