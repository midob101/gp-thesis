\subsection{Code analysis}

The \verb|gp-modifiable-ast| can be used to perform code analysis. Even though this was not the main
intention, the requirements of the project is equal to the ones required for code analysis.

All comments and whitespaces are kept. 
Specific comments are often used to disable code analysis for certain parts of code.
Whitespaces are required to check code formatting.

However as the  \verb|gp-modifiable-ast| is not implemented for a specific programming language,
some features cannot be implemented in general. For example a symbol table cannot be implemented
for all programming languages in the same way.

The main benefit of using  \verb|gp-modifiable-ast| for code analysis would be that some of the analysis actions
could be defined once and be used for multiple programming languages.

It would still be required to pass configurations for each programming language into the analysis action.
