\subsection{Unreachable code removal}

There are many cases of unreachable code, we will focus on just one case. Code that appears after a return statement in the same block, is code that will never be executed.
With this refactoring, we want to remove all code, which is happening after a return statement.

This is done by creating a selector to grab all \verb|return| statements. Once we done that, we receive the parent node of the \verb|return|. Now we loop over the children, and after we found the \verb|return| node, we begin to remove following nodes.
