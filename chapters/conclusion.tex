\section{Conclusion}

The implemented library is capable of generating an AST, which retains all informations about the original sources.
With the provided API it is possible, to traverse and modify the AST in a way to implement custom modifications to
a given source.
As the implemented library is not implemented to work for a specific programming language, it is not easily possible
to obtain informations about certain objects.
It is not easily possible to receive informations from other parts of an AST, like what type a
variable is, as these informations are dependend on the source language and may not even be part of the source file.

Therefore, this library is best used for refactorings to single nodes of an AST, which contains all informations required
to perform the refactoring. For more complex tasks, additional features will have to be implemented, for example a symbol
table.
